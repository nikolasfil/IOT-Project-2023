## Context Providers 

### Definition 

- There is another class of context data which is much more dynamic 
- This information is always changing and if it were statically held in a database, the data would be out-of-date 
- The FIWARE platform makes the gathering and presentation of real-time  context data transparent. Each NGSI request will return the latest context  by combining the data held within its database along with real-time data  readings from any registered external context providers.
